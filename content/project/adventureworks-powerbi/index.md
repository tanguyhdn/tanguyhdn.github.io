## üìä KPIs & DAX Highlights

- **Total Sales**  
  Based on the `LineTotal` from the `SalesOrderDetail` fact table.

- **Total Cost**  
  Calculated using `OrderQty √ó StandardCost`, joined from the `Product` dimension.

- **Net Profit**  
  Defined as `Total Sales - Total Cost`.

- **Profit Margin**  
  Calculated using `Net Profit / Total Sales`.

## üß† Modeling Approach

The report uses a clean **star schema** structure:

- `fSalesTransactions` as the central **fact table**
- Connected dimension tables:  
  - `dimProduct`  
  - `dimCustomer`  
  - `dimSalesPerson`  
  - `dimSalesTerritory`  
  - `dimDate` (custom calendar table)

All relationships are one-to-many, using surrogate keys for optimal performance.
